This repository contains files for a Netflix-inspired web page using HTML and CSS:

-> The HTML file represents the Netflix webpage.
-> The initial login page is styled by the stylenet.css file.
-> The subsequent feature pages are styled by stylefeat.css.
-> The FAQ page after the features is styled by stylefaq.css.
-> The footer page is styled by stylefooter.css.
-> stylemedia.css handles responsiveness for reduced viewport widths.
-> Additionally, there are image files used in the design.

Please note, this webpage isn't fully responsive as it's created using only HTML and CSS. Suggestions, improvements, or pull requests (PRs) are welcome!
